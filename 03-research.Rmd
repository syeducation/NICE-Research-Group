# Current Research Projects {#research}

We are launching, completing, and abandoning a large number of projects on a regular basis. Current projects are driven by research group members' interests, and draw heavily from the volumes of existing day collected by the group and available elsewhere. 

There are currently three large-scale projects for which we have received specific funding:

## Future STEM

Buids off previous P-STEM

Funded by NSF

## The Gothenburg Research Program on Ethnicity 

Two specific studies

Funded by Stena

## The Gothenburg Longitudinal Study of Development (GoLD)

A longitudinal study.

Funded by Forte
