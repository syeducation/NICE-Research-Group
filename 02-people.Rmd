### Edward Chou - Doctoral Student 

Edward is a generalist who has found refuge in the field of personality psychology. He is particularly interested in personality assessment. His current research interests include integrating assessments of the individual (e.g., narrative identity, psychotherapy, value fulfillment) with those that focus on between-person differences (e.g., the trait hierarchy and its maladaptive variants). Through his research and teaching, he aims to help people understand themselves better, so that they can live fulfilling lives that are appropriate for their unique combination of personality, identity, and life circumstances.
